# text_to_insta

This solution provides the means to translate JSON files containing text, usually (not) funny text, into a PNG image and post it automatically on Instagram. It was used for posting on the Instagram account https://www.instagram.com/quedescentimetres/, which is a collection of lines, quotes, sentences heard in a urban environment. 

As of 2024-04-23, it is blocked by Instagram API changing issues (IG does not allow internet browser automation anymore).
